# Algo-Trading-System
Ongoing


This is an ongoing project aimed at building an algorithmic trading system that uses Neural Networks (NN) to generate buy, sell, and hold trading signals. Currently, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 60% on US stocks, but performs suboptimally on Indian stocks.


Overview

The trading system uses a neural network model to analyze stock market data and predict trading signals. These signals guide buy, sell, or hold decisions in real-time or for backtesting purposes.Current Performance


Accuracy

Accuracy on US Stocks: The neural network model currently achieves approximately 60% accuracy on US stocks for generating trading signals.
Accuracy on Indian Stocks: The model's performance is suboptimal when applied to Indian stocks of about 40%, likely due to different market behaviors and volatility

Future Plans

Aim to integrate into a DQN which considers implicit and explicit trading cost before making trading decisions  and help automate trading tasks
